# ML-Fashion-Classifier

CS290 (Applied Machine Learning) assignment

Assignment involved building and evaluating two models on the Fashion MNIST dataset: a Multilayer Perceptron(MLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN).

The MLP consists of 3 fully connected layers and ReLU activations. It achieved a test accuracy of 82.6%, with a total parameter count of approximately 100 thousand.

The CNN consists of 2 convolutional layers, max pooling, and fully connected layers. It achieved a test accuracy of 88.9%, with a parameter count of approximately 10 thousand.

Both models were trained using cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.
